# odin_rock_paper_scissors
Simple implementation of classic "rock-paper-scissors" using JavaScript programming (TOP)

### Part 1 | Game implemented in browser console

- This is my first project utilizing what I have learned in JavaScript
- Hoping to get a deeper understanding of JavaScript functions and accessibility to a browser console
- Seeking to better understand the variations and discrepancies between JS and other programming languages i.e. Python, C, etc
- Goal is to develop better JS fundamentals and improve my instinctual memory of various JS syntax and methods.

### Part 1 | Post-Implementation Thoughts

- Everything so far was conducted using JavaScript.
- Functions and JavaScript logic were not difficult at all.
- Overall, did not take long at all, was fun to make, with nothing I haven't seen before in terms of programming.
- Helped with getting used to JavaScript fundamentals and syntax.
